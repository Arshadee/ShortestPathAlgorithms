# ShortestPathAlgorithms
This is a simple Maven Java Console App, that demo's shortest / optimum routing algorithms using different implementations.<br>
Currently just has the Dijkstra's algorithm.

**Text Document: WeightedGraphsRoutingExamples.txt** <br>
located in **/ShortestPathAlgorithms/src/main/reources/** <br>
Contains information on each of the testcases used: Graph diagram, expected shortest path solution and reference from
where the test case was obtained from.
